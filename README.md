# Data Structures and Algorithms Projects

This repository contains a collection of 12 projects completed during my internship focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with Learnsmasher. Each project implements fundamental DSA concepts using Python, demonstrating their functionality and applications.

## Projects Overview

1. **Stack**
   - Implemented using a singly linked list.
   - Supports operations: push, pop, and peek.
   - Includes infix to postfix, prefix conversion, and evaluation of expressions.

2. **Circular Queue**
   - Implemented using an array.
   - Supports operations: enqueue, dequeue, and display.
   - Efficiently manages elements in a circular fashion.

3. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
   - Implemented with nodes and pointers.
   - Supports operations: insert (handling duplicates), delete, search, and display (traversal).

4. **Threaded Binary Tree**
   - Provides threaded links to facilitate in-order and pre-order traversal.
   - Enhances traversal efficiency without recursion or stack usage.

5. **Heap Sort**
   - Implemented using both max-heap and min-heap.
   - Sorts an array of values efficiently using heap data structure principles.

6. **LRU Cache**
   - Implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache using a doubly linked list and a hash map.
   - Supports operations: get and put with O(1) time complexity for both.

7. **Graph Representation and Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**
   - Represents a city graph using adjacency matrix and adjacency list.
   - Demonstrates Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path from a single source to all destinations.

8. **Sequential File Management for Employee Data**
   - Creates a sequential file to store and manage employee records.
   - Supports operations: add, delete, and display information of employees.

9. **Basic Array Operations**
   - Implements basic operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting.
   - Includes linear search, binary search, bubble sort, and quicksort implementations.

10. **Hash Table**
    - Implements a basic hash table with key-value pair operations.
    - Includes collision resolution strategies like chaining or open addressing.

11. **Segment Tree**
    - Implements a segment tree for range query operations like finding sum or minimum in a range.
    - Supports efficient updates and queries on intervals.

12. **Stack and Queue Simulation**
    - Simulates basic operations of both stack and queue data structures.
    - Demonstrates push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue operations.

## Installation and Usage

Each project is contained within its own Python file. To run any specific project, clone the repository and execute the corresponding Python file using Python 3.x.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shrol69/internship-projects.git
cd internship-projects
python stack.py
```

## Learnings and Reflections

These projects have provided a solid foundation in DSA concepts, enhancing problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking. Each implementation addresses specific challenges and showcases practical applications of data structures and algorithms.
